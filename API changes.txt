2.0.0
    Only supports Python3.
    Depends on modules comtypes and typing.
    Removed class Win32API. Methods in Win32API were moved to globle scope.
    KeyDown, KeyUp were removed, use PressKey, ReleaseKey.
    Methods related to process were removed. Use psutil instead.
    Controls don't inherit patterns. Use Control.GetPattern(patterId) or Control.GetXxxPattern() to get a pattern and use pattern properties or methods.
        Because:
        1 two patterns may have a same method name and a control may support the two patterns at the same time.
        2 LegacyIAccessiblePattern has many properties which are same to Control's properties.
        If GetPattern or GetXxxPattern returns None, it doesn't support the pattern.
    Methods like IsXxxPatternAvailable were removed.
    Value names in class SWP changed.
    Value names in class MB changed.
    Value names in class ModifierKey changed.
    Class ShowWindow was renamed to SW.
    Removed 'Func' in variable names.
    Removed 'Dict' in variable names.
    Control.Handle to Control.NativeWindowHandle
    Control.BoundingRectangle doesn't return tuple, it returns class Rect, it has 4 properties left, top, right, bottom, 5 methods width()->int, height()->int, xcenter()->int, ycenter()->int and contains(x:int,y:int)->bool.
